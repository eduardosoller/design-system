# Soller Design System

Welcome to the repository of my Design System.
I developed this project initially for study purposes and also so that I can use it in my personal projects. Feel free to use it in your projects or as a basis to start your own design system!

## What is a Design System?

The Design System consists of a set of design patterns, components, and guidelines to ensure a consistent user experience across various applications within a company. Using a Design System facilitates standardization and maintenance of design components across all products, resulting in a more cohesive and user-friendly interface.

## Advantages of a Design System

Implementing a Design System brings the following advantages:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent look and feel throughout the user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

2. **Productivity**: Reduces redundancy by providing a reusable set of components, saving time and effort during development.

3. **Maintainability**: Facilitates updates and changes by consolidating design elements in a single repository, making maintenance easier.

## Monorepo Architecture

This repository adopts the Monorepo architecture, consolidating all related components, styles, and assets into a single repository. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Unified development environment**: Provides a standardized development environment for all team members, minimizing configuration discrepancies.

2. **Centralized configuration**: All configurations, dependencies, and tools are consolidated, simplifying the development workflow.

3. **Global changes**: Modifications and updates have a global impact, ensuring consistent changes throughout the system.
